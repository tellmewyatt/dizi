# Facing the Current

This is the git repository for my music piece "Against the Current". It is for a solo wind instrument and stereo electronics.
It was created using SuperCollider 3.13. 

## Requirements

You will need SuperCollider installed to run this piece. You will also need a stereo system and an input microphone. Preferably this should
be a small diaphragm condenser

You can download it using git or by clicking "Code" and the "Download Zip". Details on how to run the score are listed in `score.pdf`.
The entry-point is `main.scd`.
